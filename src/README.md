# Yandex.Praktikum Course 4 Project work 11 
v0.0.2

## Description
This project created to increase skills in working with GIT and get experience with WebPack.

**GIT**
*Create a repository on GitHub and copy it to your computer.
*Move the code for project work #9 to the local repository.
*Run git push origin master â€” all your files will be placed in the master branch on GitHub.
*Before you start writing code, create a new branch and switch to it. Give the branch a name-develop.
**WebPack**
*Configure the build and dev builds.
*Configure hashing of CSS and JS files.
*Create an empty file named .nojekyll in the project root. By default, GitHub Pages ignores files whose name begins with an underscore _, which is how the names of many BEM files begin. The .nojekyll file solves this problem.
*Configure automatic updating of the project page when saving files (hot reload).
*Configure the webpack to work with images and optimize them.
*Configure two build modes: development and production.
*Static images connected via an attribute in the img tag.
*Add the webpack. config file to the rules section.js setting for loading fonts.Divide the code into modules.
*Link the modules with the export and import directives.
